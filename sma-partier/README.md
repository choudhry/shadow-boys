A script that posts a notification to your choice of slack channel using webhook whenever a new excel file for 'sm√• partier' is available on systembolaget.se.

- Create a webhook on your slack integrations page, paste it into the systemet.py file.

- Uses GET requests so it needs to be set up with cronjob.
